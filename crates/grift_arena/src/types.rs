//! Core types for the arena allocator.
//!
//! This module contains the fundamental types used throughout the arena:
//! - [`ArenaIndex`] — Lightweight index into the arena's slot array.
//! - [`ArenaError`] — Enumeration of all failure modes (no heap-allocated messages).
//! - [`ArenaResult`] — Result type alias (`Result<T, ArenaError>`).
//! - [`Slot`] — Internal slot representation (free-list node or occupied value).

// — ArenaIndex —

/// Index into the arena.
///
/// This is a lightweight wrapper around `usize` that directly indexes
/// the arena's internal array.
///
/// # Safety Note
///
/// Indices should only be obtained from arena operations (`alloc`, `iter`).
/// Manually constructing indices bypasses the type system's protection
/// and should only be used for serialization/deserialization.

/// Single source of truth for every well-known arena slot.
